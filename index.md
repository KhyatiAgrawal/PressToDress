# What is PressToDress?
Currently, trying to find the perfect outfit during important on-campus events can not only be incredibly difficult and time-consuming, but expensive and inefficient. Unfortunately, the lack of a streamlined application to help Princeton students find affordable clothing on short notice for on-campus events can make the interview, formals, and lawnparties seasons more stressful than they are fun.  We seek to resolve this issue by introducing PressToDress, the go-to mobile-friendly website for Princeton students to exchange and buy clothing from fellow Princeton students.
